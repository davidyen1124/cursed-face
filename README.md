# Cursed Face Machine

One file. Infinite gremlins. Zero dignity. Maximum eyebrows.

## What Is This?
A browser‑based chaos generator that assembles faces like a sleep‑deprived cryptid stylist. It’s a single HTML file because build systems are just vibes with extra steps.

## Quick Start (because you’re busy)
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Yes, even that one.
- Click “Reroll” until you laugh, snort, or question your life choices.
- Click “Download” to save a 1200×1200 PNG. Frame it. Or don’t. I’m not your manager.

## Publish It (press nothing, win everything)
- Push to `main`. The included GitHub Pages workflow does the deployment dance for you.
- Wait a minute. Pretend you configured something complicated. Take the credit anyway.

## What’s Here
- `index.html` — the entire app, because minimalism is cheaper than devops.
- `screenshot.png` — proof this actually works (and that eyebrows matter).
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — the auto‑deploy button you never have to press.

## Features Nobody Asked For
- Reroll button: a slot machine for facial features.
- 1200×1200 exports: perfect for avatars, questionable for résumés.
- Zero dependencies: ships faster than your attention span.
- Works offline* — if the internet also works offline. See “Fine Print”.

## FAQ (Frequently Antagonizing Questions)
- Is this “AI”? — If combining bits counts, then yes; if you’re asking for a dissertation, then no.
- Will it make normal faces? — Define “normal.” Now lower your standards. There you go.
- Can I add my own parts? — It’s one file. You can add anything. Whether you should is another matter.
- Does it track me? — Only your sins. Kidding. It tracks nothing.
- Why is this so simple? — Because the best dependency is not having any.

## Troubleshooting (it’s not you, it’s Wi‑Fi)
- Nothing loads? Your network might be doing interpretive dance. Try again.
- Page won’t deploy? Push to `main` and give Pages a minute to wake up.
- PNG looks cursed? That’s a feature disguised as a feature.

## Contributing
PRs welcome. Bonus points for puns, eyebrow-related improvements, and commits that remove code instead of adding it.

## Fine Print
- Needs internet to fetch facial bits. Offline mode requires… the internet. Look, I don’t make the rules. Actually I do, and they’re bad.
- No install. No build. Only vibes. Also caffeine.
