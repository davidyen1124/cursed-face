# Cursed Face Machine

One file. Infinite gremlins. Zero dignity.

Use it
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Press “Reroll” until you cackle.
- Press “Download” to keep the chaos (1200×1200 PNG).

Publish it
- Push to `main`. The included GitHub Pages workflow deploys it for you.

What’s here
- `index.html` — the entire app.
- `screenshot.png` — proof of life (and eyebrows).
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — auto‑deploy button you don’t have to press.

Fine print
- Needs internet to fetch facial bits.
- No install. No build. Only vibes.

## Notes
- This repo was intentionally simplified to a single file per your request.
- No license included here; add one if you plan to distribute.
